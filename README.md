Inspiration

In 2019, one person was displaced every 3 seconds—20 per minute or 30,000 daily. Many who seek refuge from violence or natural disasters in urban areas struggle to access essential resources. To address this growing challenge, we aimed to make accessing these services and resources easier (UNHCR).

What it does

The website displays a map of different locations of resources in the Boston area for urban refugees. It also includes a filtering filter function that allows you to find resources based on service type, location, and accessibility. For users, all they have to do is click whatever type of service they are looking for, then click on any of the close markers, and they are able to see what kind of service is offered, contact information, and an address they can then navigate to. It also incorporates a form on the right that allows users to submit new resources found based on a location’s coordinates, service type, and etc.

How we built it

We used HTML to build the base of the website while using CSS to make it look cleaner and adhere to Urban Refuge’s aesthetic. The mapping portion of the website was made with the Leaflet javascript library where we used its layer grouping feature to create the filtering effect.

Challenges we ran into

We are all beginners; for three of us, it was our first hackathon, so we struggled especially with integrating backend functions and using Github merge. This was a valuable learning experience for all of us!

Accomplishments that we're proud of

As said before, since we are beginners, we are definitely proud to be able to finish the main function, the map, of the website and submit the project on time!

What's next for UR Aid

Integrating it into Urban Refuge’s website and adding functionality to the add location feature would be our next goals.
